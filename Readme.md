# Rest api Photo Transfer Example
I used React.js Node.js Express Cors and Multer in this project

## Explanation

Our project consists of 2 applications and 1 API. The API is live on my server. The first application, webcam-transmitter, takes a photo and sends it to the API. The second application receives the photo from the webcam-receiver API.

### Step 1: Webcam Transmitter Configurations

Go to the webcam transmitter file and install the packages with ```npm init ``` and then ```npm install```.

### Step 2: Webcam Receiver Configurations

Go to the webcam receiver file and install the packages with ```npm init ``` and then ```npm install```.

### Step 3: Launching the Server

Go to the webcam transmitter file, type ```npm start```, then do this in the webcam receiver and the application is ready.
